    <h1>My PWP</h1>
        <p>
            The main goal of my PWP is to help me learn the ins and outs of web development so I can eventually start my own web development company.
            The point of this goal is to someday work from home so that I have the freedom to spent more time with my two beautiful children.
            I'm also the husband of a wonderful woman who needs my time and support as much as I need hers. Time is something that means a lot to me, it's
            something that can't be bought and once its gone there's no getting it back so I value every second. One of the other goals I have is to create awesome
            and amazing sites to capture audiences all around the world.
        </p>

            The people that will be using and viewing this sit will be makeup inthusiests and people
            who need professional makeup done for weddings, quinceaneras, birthday's ect..
            This site is for clients who want a licensed makeup artist who does amazing and beautiful work.

            The goal of this site is to help my sister Jade start her makeup business. I want to help her show off her makeup skills to
            people in a professional manner. I also want to help increase her clientele.
